Calculate Hhours.py: This is a python program I created my freshman year of college for my mom to keep track of her hours at work. It is very basic but gets the job done. With time, I could definitely make improvements, create a GUI perhaps, and even implement more functions to remove redundant code.

Car Exhibition: This c++ program is a car tracker. The main focus on this program was learning to use linked-lists and while this program isn't perfect and there are still bugs, it achieves the use of linked-lists and still functions to an extent. There is more of a description, and the code for this program, is location in main.cpp.
